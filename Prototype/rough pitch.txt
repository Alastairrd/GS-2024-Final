rough pitch

initially looking at tackling in python, using tensorflow/keras

but unity exists, c# is more OO, haven't used UNITYML

RL:
model's he might suggest
feature engineering

pathfinding
djikstra's, a*, or leave it to model

PCG:
Kruskal, np maze generation on grid of nodes, where nodes are walls


enemies: handling combat in a way that's meaningful
shooting, do you have travelling bullets
melee combat?


do tile based, turn based, have a range, reloading time
utility theory
every turn, agent, looks at actions available
perform all of them on every possible enemy, check result of all possible actions, and pick the one with the highest score
depends on the agent, how does the agent define score, damage? dead enemies? how much health you have?

enemies can have personalities, preserving themselves caring about health
care about damage, become like kamikazes
